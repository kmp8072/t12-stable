This files describes API changes in core libraries and APIs,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 10.0 ===

* environment.xml file format was changed to use Totara major version numbers,
  use new TOTARA tag, for example: <TOTARA version="10" requires="9">
* environmentlib.php was partially refactored, do not use this internal API in custom code
* all incompatible Moodle plugin installation and update code and APIs were removed
* theme_config::get_all_block_regions() added argument $pagelayout
* core_renderer::render_file_picker flex-icon used for upload rather than CSS loaded image.
* CSS class 'link-as-button' has been removed. Please use "btn" instead
* core/templates method property renderIcon may alternatively be called with two parameters the second being a custom data object
* \core\output\block::from_block_contents() now always returns ->header attribute.
  As such, lib/templates/block.mustache has changed (removing the {{^header}} section).
* Upgraded jQuery 2.2.1 to 2.2.4
* Plugins can extend the navigation for user by declaring the following callback:
  <frankenstyle>_extend_navigation_user(navigation_node $parentnode, stdClass $user,
                                        context_user $context, stdClass $course,
                                        context_course $coursecontext)
* The function notify() now throws a debugging message - see MDL-50269.
* Ajax calls going through lib/ajax/* now validate the return values before sending the response. If the validation does not pass an exception is raised. This behaviour is consistent with web services.

=== 9.2 ===

* lib/templates/flex_icon.mustache context variable has changed, the property ->customdata->title sets the title of the flex icon
* lib/templates/flex_icon_stack.mustache context variable has changed, the property ->customdata->title sets the title of the flex icon
