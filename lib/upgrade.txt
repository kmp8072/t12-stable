This files describes API changes in core libraries and APIs,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

=== 10.0 ===

* environment.xml file format was changed to use Totara major version numbers,
  use new TOTARA tag, for example: <TOTARA version="10" requires="9">
* environmentlib.php was partially refactored, do not use this internal API in custom code
* all incompatible Moodle plugin installation and update code and APIs were removed
* theme_config::get_all_block_regions() added argument $pagelayout
* core_renderer::render_file_picker flex-icon used for upload rather than CSS loaded image.
* CSS class 'link-as-button' has been removed. Please use "btn" instead
* core/templates method property renderIcon may alternatively be called with two parameters the second being a custom data object
* \core\output\block::from_block_contents() now always returns ->header attribute.
  As such, lib/templates/block.mustache has changed (removing the {{^header}} section).
* Upgraded jQuery 2.2.1 to 2.2.4
* Plugins can extend the navigation for user by declaring the following callback:
  <frankenstyle>_extend_navigation_user(navigation_node $parentnode, stdClass $user,
                                        context_user $context, stdClass $course,
                                        context_course $coursecontext)
* The function notify() now throws a debugging message - see MDL-50269.
* Ajax calls going through lib/ajax/* now validate the return values before sending
  the response. If the validation does not pass an exception is raised. This behaviour
  is consistent with web services.
* Several changes in Moodle core, standard plugins and third party libraries to
  ensure compatibility with PHP7. All plugins are recommended to perform testing
  against PHP7 as well. Refer to https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_and_PHP7 for more
  information. The following changes may affect you:
  * Class moodleform, moodleform_mod and some module classes have been changed to use
    __construct() for the constructor. Calling parent constructors by the class
    name will display debugging message. Incorrect: parent::moodleform(),
    correct: parent::__construct()
  * All form elements have also changed the constructor syntax. No changes are
    needed for using form elements, however if plugin defines new form element it
    needs to use correct syntax. For example, incorrect: parent::HTML_QuickForm_input(),
    HTML_QuickForm_input::HTML_QuickForm_input(), $this->HTML_QuickForm_input().
    Correct: HTML_QuickForm_input::__construct() or parent::__construct().
  * profile_field_base::profile_field_base() is deprecated, use parent::__construct()
    in custom profile fields constructors. Similar deprecations in exsiting
    profile_field_* classes.
  * user_filter_type::user_filter_type() is deprecated, use parent::__construct() in
    custom user filters. Similar deprecations in existing user_filter_* classes.
  * table_default_export_format_parent::table_default_export_format_parent() is
    deprecated, use parent::__construct() in extending classes.
* groups_delete_group_members() $showfeedback parameter has been removed and is no longer
  respected. Users of this function should output their own feedback if required.
* Number of changes to Tags API, see tag/upgrade.txt for more details
* The previous events API handlers are being deprecated in favour of events 2 API, debugging messages are being displayed if
  there are 3rd party plugins using it. Switch to events 2 API please, see https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Event_2#Event_dispatching_and_observers
  Note than you will need to bump the plugin version so moodle is aware that you removed the plugin's event handlers.
* mforms validation functions are not available in the global JS namespace anymore, event listeners
  are assigned to fields and buttons through a self-contained JS function.

=== 9.2 ===

* lib/templates/flex_icon.mustache context variable has changed, the property ->customdata->title sets the title of the flex icon
* lib/templates/flex_icon_stack.mustache context variable has changed, the property ->customdata->title sets the title of the flex icon
