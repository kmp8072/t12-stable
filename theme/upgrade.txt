* A new search box for global search has been added to bootstrap and clean layout files, if
  your theme is overwriting columns1.php, columns2.php or columns3.php you will need to add a
  call to core_renderer::search_box to display it.
* Notification templates have been renamed to better suit types of alert
  rather than uses. The following changes have been made:
  * notification_problem.mustache => notification_error.mustache
  * notification_message          => notification_info
  * notification_redirect         => notification_warning
* Method core_course_renderer::course_section_cm_name() is split into two methods, custom themes that override
  this method must be modified or otherwise editing functionality may become broken. This method is now also used by
  social activities block and site menu block to display activities names.
