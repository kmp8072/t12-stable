This files describes API changes in the quiz code,

=== 10 ===

* quiz_attempt::question_print_comment_fields() has been removed. It was broken
  since at least Moodle 2.0.

* quiz::confirm_start_attempt_message and mod_quiz_view_object::$startattemptwarning
  have been deprecated. This functionality is now entirely handled within the
  quiz access rule plugins.

* The third argument to mod_quiz_renderer::start_attempt_button has been changed
  from a warning string to a mod_quiz_preflight_check_form.

* mod_quiz_renderer::review_next_navigation has a new optional argument. If you
  have overridden that method, consider updating your code to match.
