Grunt
=====

Grunt is used in Totara LMS to process JavaScript, CSS and less files,
it should be executed after every modification of files in this format.

Please note you need to purge all your caches to see your changes
or perform an upgrade triggered by a version bump.


Installation
============

1. Install nodejs and npm in your OS
2. run 'npm install' in the root directory to install all required npm modules in expected versions
3. either install grunt-cli globally using 'npm install grunt-cli -g' (you may be required to use sudo)
4. or install grunt locally via 'npm install grunt-cli' (you will have to use './node_modules/.bin/grunt' later)


Execution
=========

* Run 'grunt' from the root directory to execute all tasks in all plugins and core
* Run 'grunt' from a plugin directory to execute tasks for one plugin only (note that this may be buggy)
* Run 'grunt watch' from the root directory to execute tasks for modified files automatically


Shrink-wrapping of npm modules
==============================

npm-shrinkwrap.json file specifies what npm module versions should be used by
all developers. This file must be recreated after every modification of package.json file.

Ideally the npm modules should be updated in all branches at the same time
to minimise problems when switching branches in one checkout.

Totara employees should use the following procedure:

1. run 'grunt' and make sure everything is up-to-date before you start
2. delete node_modules/ directory
3. delete npm-shrinkwrap.json file
4. run 'npm install'
5. run 'npm shrinkwrap --dev'
6. run 'grunt'
7. verify the changes in minified JavaScript and CSS are ok
9. commit the changed files and submit for review
10. add a changelog note that developers need to 'npm install' to upgrade their dev machines
