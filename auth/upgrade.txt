This files describes API changes in /auth/* - plugins,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.

* auth_none plugin was removed for potential security reasons,
  this plugin was never intended for production servers
* deprecated plugins auth_fc, auth_imap, auth_nntp, auth_pam and auth_pop3 were removed
* Authentication plugins have been migrated to use the admin settings API.  Plugins should use a settings.php file to
  manage configurations rather than using the old config.html files. See how the helper function
  upgrade_fix_config_auth_plugin_names() can be used to convert the legacy settings to the new ones. Another helper
  function upgrade_fix_config_auth_plugin_defaults() can be used to populate the settings with default values so that
  they are not falsely reported as newly added ones.
* The function 'print_auth_lock_options' has been replaced by 'display_auth_lock_options' which uses the admin settings API.
  See auth_manual as an example of how it can be used.  More information can be found in MDL-12689.

* New auth hook - pre_user_login_hook() - available, triggered right after the user object is created.
  This can be used to modify the user object before any authentication errors are raised.
* The block_login now displays the loginpage_idp_list() links as well as main login page.
* The authentication plugin auth_radius has been moved to https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-auth_radius
* auth_plugin_base::edit_profile_url($userid = null) has a new optional user id parameter
