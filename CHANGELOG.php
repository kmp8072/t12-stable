Totara LMS Changelog

Release Evergreen 20170125 (25th January 2017):
===============================================


Security issues:

    TL-10773       Added safeguards to protect user anonymity when providing feedback within 360 Feedback
    TL-12322       Improved validation within the 360째 Feedback request confirmation form

                   Previously, if a user manipulated the HTML of the form for confirming
                   requests for feedback in 360째 Feedback, they could change emails to an
                   invalid format or, in some cases, alter requests they should not have
                   access to.
                   Additional validation following the submission of the confirmation form now
                   prevents this.

    TL-12327       Added a setting to prevent the malicious deletion of files via the Completion Import tool

                   When adding completion records for courses and certifications via CSV, a
                   pathname can be specified instead of uploading a file. After the upload
                   occurs, the target file is deleted. Users with the capability to upload
                   completion records may have been able to delete other files aside from
                   those related to completion import. In some cases they were also being
                   shown the first line of the file. By default, only site managers have the
                   capability to upload completion records.
                   Additionally in order to exploit this the web server would need to have
                   been configured to permit read/write access on the targeted files.

                   There is now a new setting ($CFG->completionimportdir) for specifying how
                   the pathname must begin in order to add completion records with this
                   method. This setting can only be added via the config.php file. When a
                   directory is specified in this setting, files immediately within it, as
                   well as within its subdirectories, can be used for completion import.

                   If the setting is not added, completion imports can no longer be performed
                   via this method. They can still be performed by uploading a file using the
                   file picker.

    TL-12411       MDL-56225: Removed unnecessary parameters when posting to a Forum

                   Previously it was possible to maliciously modify a forum post form
                   submission to fake the author of a forum post due to the presence of a
                   redundant input parameter and poor forum post submission handling.
                   The unused parameter has been removed and the post submission handling
                   improved.

    TL-12412       MDL-57531: Improved email sender handling to prevent PHPMailer vulnerabilities from being exploited
    TL-12413       MDL-57580: Improved type handling within the Assignment module

                   Previously loose type handling when submitting to an assignment activity
                   could potentially be exploited to perform XSS attacks, stricter type
                   handling has been implemented in order to remove this attack vector.

Improvements:

    TL-2276        Added a User's authentication method column and filter to all Report Builder reports that present user information
    TL-6535        Added "HR Import" as a column and filter to the user columns and filters in Reportbuilder
    TL-8552        Added additional filters to the Program Overview report source

                   Program Status and Job assignment filters have been added to the Program
                   Overview report source

    TL-8766        Added a goal description column and filter to the Goal Custom Fields report source
    TL-9016        Added content restrictions to the Goal custom fields report source

                   Content restrictions for restricting records by management, organisation
                   and position have been added to the Goal custom fields report source.

    TL-9211        Added related user filters to the Site logs report source
    TL-10849       Improved the language strings used to describe Program and Certification exception types and actions
    TL-11074       Added additional text to the manager and approver copies of original Seminar notifications
    TL-11099       Added audience membership as a badge criteria

                   This improvement adds new criteria for site-level badges which allows an
                   administrator to award a badge based on membership of an audience / cohort.

    TL-11174       Improved the display and listing of users assigned to an Appraisal

                   * The 'Learners' column on the Appraisal Management page has been changed
                   to 'Assigned' and now show the number of users assigned to the appraisal as
                   well as the number of users that have completed the assignment. For
                   'Closed' Appraisals, the number always equals completed
                   * The Assignments tab for a specific appraisal list the assigned learners
                   for appraisals in the Draft and Active state, but only lists the users that
                   completed the appraisal for Closed appraisals. The table headings reflects
                   what is shown.
                   * The reported number of assigned, completed and cancelled users shown in
                   the reports, as well as the status of the listed users now correlates
                   better to what is shown in the Management and Detail pages.

    TL-11288       Improved the accessibility of course home page actions

                   Accessible text has been added to the following course actions:
                   * Inline editing of an activities summary
                   * Changing an activities group mode

    TL-12261       Improved code exception validation in several unit tests
    TL-12353       Improved program messaging performance

Bug fixes:

    TL-10416       Fixed an error when answering appraisal competency questions as the manager's manager or appraiser
    TL-10945       Prevented loops in management job assignments in HR Import

                   Previously, if a circular management assignment was imported, HR Import
                   would fail without sensible warning. Now, if a circular management is found
                   when importing a manager with HR Import, then one or more of the users
                   forming the circular reference will fail to have their manager assigned,
                   with a notice explaining why. When importing, as many manager assignments
                   as possible will be assigned.

    TL-11150       Fixed an undefined property error in HR Import on the CSV configuration page
    TL-11238       Fixed the Seminar name link column within the Seminar sessions report
    TL-11270       Fixed Course Completion status not being set to "Not yet started" when removing RPL completions

                   Previously, when you removed RPL completion using the Course administration
                   -> Reports -> Course completion report, it would set the record to "In
                   progress", regardless of whether or not the user had actually done anything
                   that warranted being marked as such. If the user had already met the
                   criteria for completion, the record would not be updated until the
                   completion cron task next ran.

                   Now, the records will be set to "Not yet started". Reaggregation occurs
                   immediately, and may update the user to "In progress" or "Complete"
                   depending on their progress. Note that if a course is set to "Mark as In
                   Progress on first view" and the user had previously viewed the course but
                   made no other progress, then their status will still be "Not yet started"
                   after reaggregation.

    TL-11316       Fixed an error when cloning an Appraisal containing aggregated questions
    TL-12243       Fixed a Totara menu issue leading to incorrectly encoded ampersands
    TL-12256       Prevented an incorrect redirect occurring when dismissing a notification from within a modal dialog
    TL-12263       Fixed an issue with the display of assigned users within 360째 Feedback

                   The assigned group information is no longer shown for 360째 Feedback in the
                   Active or Closed state. In these states, the pages always reflect actual
                   assigned users.

    TL-12277       Corrected an issue where redirects with a message did not have a page URL set
    TL-12280       Fixed a bug preventing block weights being cloned when a dashboard is cloned
    TL-12283       Fixed several issues on the waitlist page when Seminar approval type is changed

                   The waitlist page showed the wrong approval date (1 Jan 1970) and debug
                   messages when a seminar changed its approval type from no approval required
                   to manager approved.

    TL-12284       Fixed an upgrade error due to an incorrectly unique index in the completion import tables on SQL Server

                   Previously, if a site running SQL Server had imported course or
                   certification completions, there could have been an error when trying to
                   upgrade to Totara 9. This has been fixed. Sites that had already
                   successfully upgraded will have the unique index replaced with a non-unique
                   equivalent.

    TL-12287       Ensured Hierarchy 'ID number' field type is set as string in Excel and ODS format exports to avoid incorrect automatic type detection
    TL-12297       Removed options from the Reportbuilder "message type" filter when the corresponding feature is disabled
    TL-12299       Fixed an error on the search page when setting Program assignment relative due dates
    TL-12301       Fixed the replacement of course links from placeholders in notifications when restoring a Seminar

                   Previously when a course URL was embedded in a seminar notification
                   template, it would be changed to a placeholder string when the seminar was
                   backed up. Restoring the seminar would not change the placeholder back to
                   the proper URL. This fix ensures it does.

    TL-12303       Fixed the HTML formatting of Seminar notification templates for third-party emails
    TL-12305       Fixed incorrect wording in Learning Plan help text
    TL-12311       Fixed the "is after" criteria in the "Start date" filter within the Course report source

                   The "is after" start date filter criteria now correctly searching for
                   courses starting immediately after midnight in the users timezone.

    TL-12315       Waitlist notifications are now sent when one message per date is enabled

                   If a Seminar event was created with no dates, people could still sign up
                   and be waitlisted.
                   However, they would only receive a sign up email if the "one message per
                   date" option was off.
                   Now, the system will send the notification regardless of this setting.

    TL-12323       Removed references to the SCORM course format from course format help string
    TL-12325       Fixed the Quick Links block to ensure it decodes URL entities correctly
    TL-12333       Made improvements to the handling of invalid job assignment dates
    TL-12337       Fixed the formatting of event details placeholder in Seminar notifications
    TL-12339       Reverted removal of style causing regression in IE

                   TL-11341 applied a patch for a display issue in Chrome 55.
                   This caused a regression for users of Edge / IE browsers making it
                   difficult and in some cases impossible to click grouped form elements.
                   The Chrome rendering bug has since been addressed.

    TL-12344       Fixed an error message when updating Competency scale values
    TL-12352       Fixed a bug in the cache API when fetching multiple keys having specified MUST_EXIST

                   Previously when fetching multiple entries from a cache, if you specified
                   that the data must exist, in some circumstances the expected exception was
                   not being thrown.
                   Now if MUST_EXIST is provide to cache::get_many() an exception will be
                   thrown if one or more of the requested keys cannot be found.

    TL-12369       Marked class totara_dialog_content_manager as deprecated

                   This class is no longer in use now that Totara has multiple job
                   assignments. Class totara_job_dialog_assign_manager should be used instead.

Miscellaneous Moodle fixes:

    TL-12406       MDL-57100: Prevented javascript exceptions from being displayed during an AJAX request
    TL-12407       MDL-56948: Fixed Assignment bug when viewing a submission with a grade type of "none"
    TL-12408       MDL-57163: Improved the feedback given when trying to install without the curl extension installed

Release Evergreen 20161221 (21st December 2016):
=======================================

Important:

    TL-10980       Totara 10 can be upgraded from Totara 9 only

                   It is important to note that sites running on Totara 2.9 or earlier are
                   required to upgrade through Totara 9.
                   If you are intending to upgrade from Totara 2.9 to Totara 10 you must
                   upgrade to Totara 9 before upgrading to Totara 10.

    TL-10994       Introduction of the Evergreen maturity

                   A new product maturity setting has been introduced, MATURITY_EVERGREEN.
                   This new maturity will be used only for Evergreen releases and should be
                   considered stable.

    TL-11161       Removed Kiwifruit responsive theme

                   As Kiwifruit responsive has been deprecated previously, it has now been
                   removed.

                   If you wish to continue using Kiwifruit responsive (NOTE: it will no longer
                   be supported so there is a high likelyhood things will be broken), please
                   follow these steps (on top of a normal upgrade process):
                   1. Take a backup of theme/kiwifruitresponsive
                   2. Update the Totara code base (this will remove the kiwifruit responsive
                      theme
                   3. Restore theme/kiwifruitresponsive into it's original location
                   4. Run the Totara LMS upgrade script.

                   If step 4 is done before step 3, all settings that were in Kiwifruit
                   responsive will have been removed (and may need to be restored).

    TL-11333       Fixes from Moodle 3.0.7 have been included in this release

                   Information on the issues included from this Moodle release can be found
                   further on in this changelog.

    TL-11369       Date related form elements exportValue() methods were fixed to return non array data by default

                   All custom code using MoodleQuickForm_date_time_selector::exportValue() or
                   \MoodleQuickForm_date_selector::exportValue() must be reviewed and fixed if
                   necessary.

Security issues:

    TL-5254        Improved user verification within the Quick Links block
    TL-11133       Fixed Seminar activities allowing sign up even when restricted access conditions are not met
    TL-11194       Fixed get_users_by_capability() when prohibit permissions used
    TL-11335       MDL-56065: Fixed the update_users web service function
    TL-11336       MDL-53744: Fixed question file access checks
    TL-11338       MDL-56268: Format backtrace to avoid displaying private data within web services

Improvements:

    TL-7221        Added time selectors to Before and After date criteria in dynamic audience rules
    TL-7954        Added customisable manager subjects to program messages

                   This patch adds a new setting to the emails form on the program messages
                   tab. The new text field "manager subject" sits between the "send notice to
                   manager" checkbox and the "notice for manager" text area. This new setting
                   allows you to edit the subject line for managers receiving the email about
                   their staff member. If the field is left blank the message will continue to
                   use the old strings.

    TL-9299        Improved the performance of the program completion scheduled task
    TL-9756        Removed an HTML table when viewing a plan that has been changed after approval
    TL-9849        Replaced the filepicker and filemanager upload icons with flex icons
    TL-10119       Spacing and alignment improved between user and 'burger' menu on mobile devices.
    TL-10254       Improved accessibility when viewing the course user outline report
    TL-10404       Added copy manager setting to Seminar notification templates
    TL-10414       Ensured collapsable section header is no longer displayed when empty within Appraisals
    TL-10670       Implemented position, organisation, job assignment and custom user profile field value sync in Totara Connect

                   Totara Sync can now be configured to synchronise Positions, Organisations,
                   Job Assignments, and custom user profile field values between connected LMS
                   instances.

                   Please be aware of the following limitations:
                   * Custom user profile field values will only be synced if the client site
                     has custom profile fields configured with short names that match exactly
                     those on the server.
                   * Positions, and Organisations items will only be synced if the client site
                     has a framework type with an idnumber matching exactly the type of the
                     position or organisation on the server.

    TL-10833       Added two new settings to control the maximum width and height of graphs within the Report Graph block

                   There are two new settings for the Report Graph block:

                   * Max width
                   * Max height

                   These allow you to control the proportions of the graph that is displayed
                   by this block, ensuring that it is suitably sized for the location of your
                   block.
                   By default the graph will continue to consume the available space, as it
                   has done previously.
                   It should also be noted that the aspect ratio of the graph is maintained.

    TL-10952       Links that should be styled as buttons now look like buttons in Basis & Roots themes
    TL-10971       Improved Feedback activity export formatting

                   The following improvements were made to the exported responses for feedback
                   activities:
                   * Newlines in Long Text responses are no longer replaced with the html <br/> tag
                   * The text wrap attribute is set for all response cells
                   * Long text, Short text and Information responses are no longer exported in bold

    TL-11054       Only the available regions are shown when configuring a block's position on the current page

                   Previously, when configuring blocks, all possible regions were shown when
                   setting the region for a block on the current page. This setting now only
                   has the options that exist on the page

    TL-11056       Added phpunit support for third party modules that use "coursecreator" role
    TL-11075       Improved inline help for Seminar's "Manager and Administrative approval" option
    TL-11117       Removed unused, redundant, legacy hierarchy code
    TL-11121       Added new program completion criteria to site badges
    TL-11145       Newly created learning plans now include competencies from all of a user's job assignments
    TL-11198       Added support for add-on report builder sources in column tests

                   Add-on developers may now add phpunit_column_test_add_data() and
                   phpunit_column_test_expected_count() methods to their report sources to
                   pass the full phpunit test suit with add-ons installed.

    TL-11261       Converted folder and arrow icon in file form control to flex icons
    TL-11273       Removed an unnecessary fieldset surrounding admin options
    TL-11289       Dropping a file onto the course while editing now has alternative text

                   This also converts the image icon to a flex icon.

Bug fixes:

    TL-7666        Images used in hierarchy custom fields are now displayed correctly when viewing or reporting on the hierarchy

    TL-10744       Fixed footer navigation column stacking in the Roots and Basis themes
    TL-10915       Ensured that courses are displayed correctly within the Current Learning block when added via a Certification
    TL-10953       Fixed Learning Plans using the wrong program due date

                   Previously, given some unlikely circumstances, when viewing a program in a
                   learning plan, it was possible that the program due date could have been
                   displaying the due date for one of the course sets instead.

    TL-11000       When calculating the Aggregate rating for appraisal questions, not answered questions and zero values may now be included in aggregate calculations

                   Two new settings have been added to Aggregate rating questions within
                   Appraisals.
                   These can be used in new aggregate rating questions to indicate how the
                   system must handle unanswered questions, as well as questions resulting in
                   a zero score during the calculations.

    TL-11063       Fixed a PHP error in the quiz results statistics processing when a multiple choice answer has been deleted
    TL-11072       Administrative approver can do final approval of seminar bookings in two stage approvals prior to manager
    TL-11076       Fixed the display of the attendee name for Seminar approval requests in the Task/Alert report
    TL-11110       Added validation warning when creating management loops in job assignments

                   Previously, if you tried to assign a manger which would result in a
                   circular management structure, it would fail and show an error message. Now
                   it shows a validation warning explaining the problem.

    TL-11124       Treeview controls in dialogs now display correctly in RTL languages
    TL-11126       Fixed HR Import data validation being skipped in some circumstances

                   If the source was an external database, and the first record in the import
                   contained a null, then the data validation checks on that column were being
                   skipped. This has been fixed, and the data validation checks are now fully
                   covered by automated tests.

    TL-11129       Fixed url parameters not being added in pagination for the enrolled audience search dialog
    TL-11130       Fixed how backup and restore encodes and decodes links in all modules
    TL-11137       Courses, programs and certifications will always show in the Record of Learning if the user has made progress or completed the item

                   The record of learning is intended to list what the user has achieved.
                   Previously, if a user had completed an item of learning, this may sometimes
                   have been excluded due to visibility settings (although not in all cases
                   with standard visibility). The effect of audience visibility settings and
                   available to/from dates have been made consistent with that of standard
                   visibility. The following are now show on their applicable Record of
                   Learning embedded reports, regardless of enrolment status and current
                   visibility of the item elsewhere.

                   Courses:  Any course where a user's status is greater than 'Not yet
                   started'. This includes 'In-progress' and 'Complete'.

                   Programs: Any program where the user's status is greater than 'Incomplete'.
                   In existing Totara code, this will only be complete programs. This applies
                   to the status of the program only and does not take into account program
                   course sets. If just a course set were complete, and not the program, the
                   program would not show on the Record of Learning if it should not otherwise
                   be visible.

                   Certifications: Any certification where the user's status is greater than
                   'Newly assigned'. This includes 'In-progress', 'Certified' and 'Expired'.

    TL-11139       Fixed report builder access permissions for the authenticated user role

                   The authenticated user role was missed out when a report's access
                   restriction was "user role in any context" - even if this role was ticked
                   on the form. The fix now accounts for the authenticated user.

    TL-11148       Fixed suspended course enrolments not reactivating during user program reassignment
    TL-11191       Ensured the calendar block controls are displayed correctly in RTL languages
    TL-11200       Fixed the program enrolment plugin which was not working for certifications when programs had been disabled
    TL-11203       Allowed access to courses via completed programs consistently

                   Previously if a user was complete with a due date they could not access any
                   courses added to the program after completion, but users without a due date
                   could access the new courses. Now any user with a valid program assignment
                   can access the courses regardless of their completion state.

    TL-11208       Fixed unnecessary comma appearing after user's name in Seminar attendee picker

                   When only "ID Number" is selected in the showuseridentity setting and a
                   user does not have an ID number an extra comma was displayed after the
                   user's name in the user picker when adding / removing Seminar attendees.

    TL-11209       Fixed errors in some reports when using report caching and audience visibility
    TL-11213       Fixed undefined index warnings while updating a Seminar event without dates
    TL-11216       Fixed incorrect use of userid when logging a program view from required learning
    TL-11217       Flex icons now use the title attribute correctly
    TL-11237       Deleting unconfirmed users no longer deletes the user record

                   Previously when unconfirmed users were deleted by cron the user record was
                   deleted from the database immediately after the standard deletion routines
                   were run.
                   Because it is possible to include unconfirmed users in dynamic audiences
                   they could end up with traces in the database which may not be cleaned up
                   by the standard deletion routines.
                   The deletion of the user record would then lead to these traces becoming
                   orphaned.
                   This behaviour has been changed to ensure that the user record is never
                   deleted from the database, and that user deletion always equates to the
                   user record being marked as deleted instead.

    TL-11239       Fixed type handling within the role_assign_bulk function leading to users not being assigned in some situations
    TL-11246       Added default sort order of attendees on the Seminar sign-in sheet

                   The sort order was the order in which the attendees was added. This patch
                   adds a default sort order to the embedded report so that users are listed
                   in alphabetical order. Note: for existing sites the sign-in sheet embedded
                   report will need to be reset on the manage reports page (doing this will
                   reset any customisations to this report)

    TL-11263       Loosened cleaning on Program and Certification summary field making it consistent with course summary
    TL-11272       Fixed inaccessible files when viewing locked appraisal questions
    TL-11309       HR Import now converts mixed case usernames to lower case

                   Now when you import a username with mixed case you will receive a warning,
                   the username will be converted to lower case and the user will be
                   imported.
                   This patch brings the behaviour in Totara 9 in line with Totara 2.9.

    TL-11329       Fixed program course sets being marked complete due to ignoring "Minimum score"

                   When a program or certification course set was set to "Some courses" and
                   "0", the "Minimum score" was being ignored. Even if a "Minimum score" was
                   set and was not reached, the course set was being marked complete. Now, if
                   a "Minimum score" is set, users will be required to reach that score before
                   the course set is marked complete, in combination with completing the
                   required number of courses.

                   If your site has a program or certification configured in this way, and you
                   find users who have been incorrectly marked complete, you can use the
                   program or certification completion editor to change the records back to
                   "Incomplete" or "Certified, window is open". You should then wait for the
                   "Program completions" scheduled task (runs daily by default) to calculate
                   which stage of the program the user should be at.

    TL-11331       Fixed HTML and multi language support for general and embedded reports
    TL-11341       Fixed report builder filter display issue in chrome 55

                   Previously there was a CSS statement adding a float to a legend which
                   appears to be ignored by most browsers. With the release of chrome 55, this
                   style was being interpreted.

    TL-12244       Fixed 'Allow extension request' setting not being saved when adding programs and certifications
    TL-12246       Fixed MSSQL query for Course Completion Archive page
    TL-12248       Fixed layout of Totara forms when using RTL languages

API changes:

    TL-8423        Changed course completion to only trigger processing of related programs

                   Previously, course completion caused completion of all of a user's programs
                   and certifications to be re-processed. Now, only programs which contain
                   that course are processed.

    TL-10649       core/block template now uses the same variable for the skip block link
    TL-11225       \totara_form\model::get_current_data(null) now returns all current form data
