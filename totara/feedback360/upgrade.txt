This file describes API changes in Totara Feedback360,
information provided here is intended especially for developers.


=== 10 ===

* New database field requestertoken added to the feedback360_resp_assignment table.
This is will hold sha1 hashes unique to each response. If the user who requested feedback is viewing responses,
the response should be queried via this value, particularly if anonymous feedback is used.
When a user that has requested feedback views a response, a 'responseid' in the url can no longer
be used to fetch feedback, they must use the 'requestertoken'. This does not apply to users who are
submitting feedback.
* Reduced specificy of CSS selectors to improve RTL support
* Renamed CSS class "previewer" to "feedback360-previewer" so that it did not clash with the same CSS class in appraisals
