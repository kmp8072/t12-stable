      "description": "Cleaning up the large number of groundwater contamination sites is a significant and complex environmental challenge.  The environmental industry is continuously looking for remediation methods that are both effective and cost-efficient. Over the past 10 years there have been amazing, important developments in our understanding of key attenuation processes and technologies for evaluating natural attenuation processes, and a changing institutional perspective on when and where Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) may be applied.  Despite these advances, restoring groundwater contaminated by anthropogenic sources to allow for unrestricted use continues to be a challenge. Because of a complex mix of physical, chemical, and biological constraints associated with active in-situ cleanup technologies, there has been a long standing focus on understanding natural processes that attenuate groundwater contaminant plumes.\n\nWe will build upon basic environmental science and environmental engineering principles to discover how to best implement MNA as a viable treatment for groundwater contamination plumes.  Additionally we will delve into the history behind and make predictions about the new directions for this technology.  \n\nAny professional working in the environmental remediation industry will benefit from this in-depth study of MNA.  We will use lectures, readings, and computational exercises to enhance our understanding and implementation of MNA.  At the completion of this course, students will have updated understanding and practical tools that can be applied to all possible MNA sites.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECommitment\u003C\/strong\u003E: \u003C\/p\u003E",

Each week is divided into the different components of the Marketing Strategy: Market Analysis, Marketing Strategy, Marketing Mix Implementation and Expected Results. Review each week\u2019s theory and concrete the takeaways with quizzes aimed at reinforcement of the concepts.\n\nAfter reviewing the material learned you will be asked to analyse the case study: \u00a8Hotel Ipsum: A Marketing and Commercial Strategy to Survive.\u00a8 Now it\u2019s time to put what you\u2019ve learned to the test! Hotel Ipsum\u2019s General Manager, Rafael Escobedo, is faced with a dilemma: Despite his hotel doing fairly well in terms of sales and profitability, Rafael\u2019s Board of Directors are not satisfied and are demanding an improvement in results. Now it\u2019s up to you to create Rafael\u2019s Marketing Strategy. The outcome could mean one of two things: praise from his Board of Directors\u2026or unemployment!\n\nAlong with the Capstone are discussion forums, quizzes and peer reviews to aid you in your understanding of the theory given throughout this Specialization. Share your thoughts, ideas and debate with other like-minded learners from all over the globe with the same interest in expanding their marketing knowledge.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECommitment\u003C\/strong\u003E: \u003C\/p\u003E",

      "description": "March 2014 marked the starting point of the largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease in history. Although the disease seems to be on a decrease, we are not there yet and new outbreaks will surely emerge. New efforts to combat the outbreak are necessary. This is why we developed this online course about Ebola, targeted at health professionals across the world.\n\nIn this course you will cover the fundamental knowledge any health professional should have with expected or confirmed cases or a general interest in the Ebola disease. You will discuss the epidemiology of the disease, its  pathophysiology and transmission, the clinical presentation including differential diagnosis and confirmation of disease. You will also discuss the general therapeutic approach to the care of Ebola suspected or confirmed patients and discuss the novel vaccine and drug developments.\n\nAs the Ebola crisis continues to rage through the affected areas, we need health professionals like yourself to be informed and involved.\n\nThis course is developed in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Amsterdam, the University Medical Center Utrecht (Julius Center\/Julius Global Health), Elevate Health, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and the Lion Heart Foundation.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECommitment\u003C\/strong\u003E: \u003C\/p\u003E",

      "description": "In this introductory, self-paced course, you will learn multiple theories of organizational behavior and apply them to actual cases of organizational change.\n\nOrganizations are groups whose members coordinate their behaviors in order to accomplish a shared goal. They can be found nearly everywhere in today\u2019s society: universities, start-ups, classrooms, hospitals, non-profits, government bureaus, corporations, restaurants, grocery stores, and professional associations are some of many examples of organizations.\n\nOrganizations are as varied and complex as they are ubiquitous: they differ in size and internal structure; they can entail a multiplicity of goals and tasks (some of which are planned and others unplanned!); they are made up of individuals whose goals and motivations may differ from those of the group; and they must interact with other organizations and deal with environmental constraints in order to be successful. This complexity frequently results in a myriad of problems for organizational participants and the organization\u2019s survival.\n\nIn this course, we will use organizational theories to systematically analyze how an organization operates and can best be managed. Organizational theories highlight certain features of an organization\u2019s structure and environment, as well as its processes of negotiation, production, and change. Each provides a lens for interpreting novel organizational situations and developing a sense for how individual and group behaviors are organized. Theories are valuable for the analyst and manager because most organizational problems are unique to the circumstances and cannot be solved by simple rules of thumb. Armed with a toolset of organizational theories, you will be able to systematically identify important features of an organization and the events transforming it; choose a theoretical framework most applicable to the observed mode of organizing; and use that theory to determine which actions will best redirect the organization in desired directions.\n\nIn sum, the course has three goals: to become familiar with a series of real-world organizational phenomena; to learn different theoretical perspectives that can elucidate these phenomena; and to apply these different ways of \u201cseeing\u201d and managing organizations to cases. In such a fashion, the course is designed to actively bridge theory and practice, exposing students to a variety of conceptual tools and ways to negotiate novel situations.\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECommitment\u003C\/strong\u003E: \u003C\/p\u003E",

      "description": "Few kinds of communication can have the effect of a powerful presentation.  Even a short speech can motivate people to change long-held beliefs or to take action, and a wonderfully delivered speech can transform a normal person into a leader.\n\nIn this course, Prof. William Kuskin provides a series of pragmatic videos and exercises for successful public speaking and presentations. The course develops through four themes\u2014mastering fear, developing a creative formula, using verbal and body language, and anticipating the room\u2014so that you can discover your personal power as a speaker and give excellent presentations.  \n\nSuccessful presentations do not rely on perfect teeth, a deep voice, or an army of scriptwriters.  They depend largely on the same skills as successful Business Writing and Graphic Design: clarity, structure, and revision. The goal of the course, therefore, is to enable you to discover your own internal power as a speaker and express it to the world.  After this course, with some practice, you will be able to go into any situation and command the room for as long as you like. \u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECommitment\u003C\/strong\u003E: \u003C\/p\u003E",
