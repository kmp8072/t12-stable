* The xmlrpc backend has changed, Zend_XmlRpc has been dropped and there might be slight differences in
  responses. Fault strings that were generated by Zend_XmlRpc_XXX_Exception exceptions (i.e. 'Method
  "[methodname]" does not exist') are no longer used which may display a different error message depending
  on the string returned by the getMessage() method of the thrown exception.
