* Introduced block_edit_form::has_general_settings() method to keep backward compatibility.
  All custom blocks which implement 'block_edit_form' need to be updated. Until they implement 'has_general_settings()' method they will continue to operate as before.
  If they implement either of 'block title' or 'block docking' settings already (and use the same config keys) then simply remove the code.
  All custom blocks need to implement 'has_general_settings()' function to indicate that they have been updated to use the new system.
  The block_edit_form::has_general_settings() method will be removed entirely in the next major version.
* The block_settings_edit_form::specific_definition() method has been deprecated, use block_edit_form::specific_definition() method instead.
* The block_mentees_edit_form::specific_definition() method has been deprecated, use block_mentees_edit_form::specific_definition() method instead.
